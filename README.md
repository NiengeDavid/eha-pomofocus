> Remade of Pomofocus.io, a web-based Pomodoro Timer I love to boost your productivity

[Pomotama](https://pomotama.netlify.app/) is a Pomodoro timer app inspired by [Pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/), built with React and TypeScript. I love Pomofocus.io so much that I'm basically using it every day while doing tasks. While it's being really helpful to my productivity flow, I feel like I can improve the app to suit my need more. Therefore, I built this side project for both learning purposes and personal usage.

## ‚ùì What is Pomodoro Technique

<section>
  <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a structured method that divides work into 25-minute focused sessions followed by 5-minute breaks. After completing four sessions, you take a longer break of 15-30 minutes.</p>

  <p>The Pomodoro Technique is known for its simplicity. It helps you break down tasks into manageable intervals and avoid burnout by incorporating regular breaks.</p>
